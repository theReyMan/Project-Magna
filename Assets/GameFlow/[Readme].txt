GameFlow v1.0
----------------

GameFlow is a powerful yet easy to use visual programming toolkit designed to help you bring your game prototypes to life in the shortest possible time.


Installation 
-------------

IMPORTANT: GameFlow requires Unity 5.6 or newer. Please upgrade Unity before importing or updating the GameFlow package.

Once purchased on the Unity Asset Store and downloaded the GameFlow package should be already installed on your system and ready to use in your projects. The only required step is to import the package into your project in one of these two ways:

1) If you are creating a new project, just mark the checkbox "GameFlow.unityPackage" in the New Project window to get the package automatically imported.

2) If you need to import GameFlow into an existing project, log in the Asset Store (Window > Asset Store) and toggle the Download Manager, then Find the GameFlow package and click on the Import button to get the package automatically imported into the current project.

If you need further information on installation or the update process, please refer to the "First Steps" chapter in the User Guide.


Documentation & Help
-----------------------

You can access the online documentation by double clicking any of the links you will find under the GameFlow/Documentation folder. Documentation is available in English (-EN) and Spanish (-ES).

Reference help for each block is also available as the last option in the context menu. The context menu is displayed by clicking on the "gear" icon to be found in the upper right corner of any GameFlow component or block in the Inspector.
